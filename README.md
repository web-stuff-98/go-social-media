This is the newest version of my Go project, it has much cleaner structure. It uses net/http, gorilla mux and gorilla websocket, and it has blogging with embedded comments, it isn't broken and theres a way of easily subscribing to stuff using the SocketServer struct.

I will add some react 18 features like suspense and write tests for components when I am done
