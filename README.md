This is the second version of my Go project, it has much cleaner structure. It uses net/http, gorilla mux and gorilla websocket, it has chunked file streaming, all the features of prisma-social-media and it isn't broken because its my second Go project.

I will add some react 18 features like suspense and write tests for components when I am done completely
