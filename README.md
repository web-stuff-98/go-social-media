This is my Golang social media personal project. I made tests for the React components.

This is also my 2nd Go project. There are race conditions which cause the server to crash after a while.
I have finished all its features so now I'm trying to fix those race conditions.

## Features
 - Private & group video chat
 - Filesharing
 - Live embedded comments
 - Live blog
 - Lazy loaded images with placeholders
 - Rich text editor
 - Mobile responsive
 - Dark mode
