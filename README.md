This is the newest version of my Go project, it has much cleaner structure. It uses net/http, gorilla mux and gorilla websocket, and it has blogging with embedded comments, it isn't broken and theres a way of easily subscribing to stuff using the SocketServer struct.

It is also not done, blogging works aside from voting which is unfinished, private conversations work.

DetermineSocketEvent.ts shows how things work in relation to the backend with sockets sort of.
