This is the newest version of my Go project, it has much cleaner structure. It uses net/http, gorilla mux and gorilla websocket, and it has blogging with embedded comments, and it isn't broken.

It is basically a clone of Prisma-Social-Media, except the UI is done with SASS instead of Tailwind.

It is not done. I need to add chatrooms, improve the UI, add rate limiters and maybe replace the auth check in the API routes with middleware. Also some optimizations.
